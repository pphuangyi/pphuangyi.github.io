## How to add a paper
1. Make a new folder in the [papers folder](./papers). Name the new folder by `[year]_[TitleWithoutSpace]`.
2. Download the PDF of the paper and put it into `[year]_[TitleWithoutSpace]`. Name the PDF file by `paper.pdf` and name the supplementary material, if available, by `suppl.pdf`.
3. Create a subfolder named `figure` under `[year]_[TitleWithoutSpace]`. And cut a few figures from the paper and save them to the subfolder.
4. Use LaTex or MicroSoft Paint to combined the figures.
5. Add a new item in the res.jemdoc with abstract and figure explanation.
